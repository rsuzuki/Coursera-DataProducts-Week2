# Airport Coordinates

Coursera's *Developing Data Products* Week 2 Assigment.

There are two R *html* files:

* [airport_presentation.html](./airports_presentation.html): map in presentation form.
* [airports_webpage.html](./airports_webpage.html): map in HTML form.

*Note:* I've tried to view the actual HTML through *https://htmlpreview.github.io*, but the map itself did not show up on it. For peer-review purposes, please download the html files and open it locally.
